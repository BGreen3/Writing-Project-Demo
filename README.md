# Writing-Project-Demo
Once upon a time, there were two teachers who decided to experiment with a new collaborative forum to help their students become extraordinary writers. The project kept growing and getting better.

Question 1: How do students use GitHub to collaborate on their writing project? What are the steps?
1. Writer 1/ "Master"- Create a repository and create the foundation of story
2. Writer 2- "Fork" the repository, then add changes, then submit a "pull request" to "master" writer
3. Writer 1- Review suggestions and then "Merge" and "commit" to make changes permanent 
*Note: Writer 1 has ultimate control of the repository 

OR... Can two collaborators simultaneously write in repository? (Settings/Add collaborator/search username)

Question 2: How do teachers see student work and track changes? Can a third party join to track changes and make comments to each contributor's changes?
This is a test from Carol
