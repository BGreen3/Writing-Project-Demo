# Writing-Project-Demo

Project Objective:

All writing is collaborative, whether it is by peer mentoring, conferencing with a teacher, or working with an editor. The purpose of this project is to encourage the development of writing confidence and skill sets by pairing students of different age groups for this cross-campus, collaborative experience.

To enhance our writing program, we will introduce GitHub as a means for Lower School and Upper School students to collaborate on their stories. In effect, not only will students develop as collaborative writers as the primary objective states, but in addition, they will work with a program that many engineers and computer programmers use to communicate change in coding systems. Both of these objectives address 21st century skills, and will provide students with “Maker’s” tools. 

Embedded in GitHub is the ability to share our project worldwide. As the world’s largest open source community, students will be able to “publish” their projects and be visible to a wide audience. 
 
The cost of the GitHub software that we will require is $22/month. This will allow for 20 private repositories with unlimited collaborators and use. We will need to to purchcase this package for three months: November, December, January. 

Third Grade Common Core Standards Alignment:
•	Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, descriptive details, and clear event sequences. 
•	Establish a situation and introduce a narrator and/or characters; organize an event sequence that unfolds naturally.
•	Use dialogue and descriptions of actions, thoughts, and feelings to develop experiences and events or show the response of characters to situations.  
•	Provide a sense of closure. 
•	With guidance and support from peers and adults, produce writing in which the development and organization are appropriate to task and purpose. 
•	With guidance and support from peers and adults, develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, and editing. 

Ninth and Tenth Grade Common Core Standards Alignment
• Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage when writing.
• Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling when writing.
• Use various types of phrases (noun, verb, adjectival, adverbial, participial, prepositional, absolute) and clauses (independent, dependent; noun, relative, adverbial) to convey specific meanings and add variety and interest to writing or presentations.

Cognitive Objectives:
•	Understand fiction story structure, including beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution/denouement
•	Use a graphic organizer (plot diagram) to brainstorm ideas 
•	Collaborate in the drafting process in following manner:
3rd grade begins- Elements revises, completes the beginning, and writes notes via GitHub to share ideas on story development
3rd grade responds to Element’s suggestions- writes middle- Elements revises, completes middle, and writes notes via Git Hub to share ideas on development
3rd grade responds to Element’s suggestions- writes resolution- Elements revises, completes end, revises complete work- edits- publishes, including illustrations
Elements shares final product with 3rd graders, meeting together to celebrate the writing process
•	Learn how to use GitHub to communicate changes to writing collaborators 
•	Publish writing process to the wider community via GitHub

Affective Objectives:
•	Enjoy the creative writing process
•	Reflect on the collaborative nature of writing 
• Gain confidence in skills and abilities as writers, especially Upper School students who are placed in Elements based on     previously demonstrated needs as writers 

Social Objectives:
•	Learn collaboration skills, such as explicit communication
•	Give specific feedback, requests, ideas for story development
•	Be receptive to peer revisions and criticism 

Anticipatory Set/ Pre-writing: 
•	3rd grade: Read various picture books/short stories 
•	Students are introduced to a plot diagram
•	Students chart the plot of 3-4 picture books focusing on the theme of adventure (specifically getting a character from one place to another with a purpose), noticing different elements of a beginning, middle, and end
•	3rd grade students prewrite the story by brainstorming a story line, using a plot diagram, focusing on beginning, middle, and end
•	Discuss how in the collaborative writing process, the original idea may change based on the collaborator’s input
• Upper School students up to this point in the semester have been examining correct usage, punctuation, and editing skills 

Assessment:
•	Teachers will be able to see the development of student drafts through GitHub software program
•	Students will complete and publish a final draft of the collaborative writing project, and publish their work process through GitHub 

Special Considerations and Accommodations:
•	Carol and Brooke will meet to consider personal interests, writing styles, and learning needs of students and pair students accordingly for greatest success.

What is GitHub?

From Wiki: [GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.[3]

GitHub offers both plans for private repositories and free accounts,[4] which are usually used to host open-source software projects.[5] As of 2015, GitHub reports having over 9 million users and over 21.1 million repositories,[6] making it the largest code hoster in the world.[7]]

Why use GitHub in the classroom for our writing project?

1. GitHub provides collaborative writing forum.
2. Teachers can access drafts to see what each student has contributed individually.
3. Teachers can comment, ask questions, and suggest edits and revisions. 
4. Students can insert comments on a given line.
5. Students have the opportunity to make a copy of the original document ("Fork"), and make revisions that can be made permanent onto the original draft or can be omitted altogether. 
6. Students will become familiar with a collaborative forum intended for coding. They will learn the language and basic structure of GitHub for future use of coding. 

How do you use GitHub?
1. Set up account using email. Create username and password for each collaborator. 
2. Create repository: Use last names or working title for story. 
3. Add collaborators: settings/add collaborator/search username (each student pod will have their own repository/ Carol and Brooke will also be collaborators for each student repository)
4. Students write in text. They must "commit" changes once they are finished with draft section. 

Alternate/advanced revising strategy: (This will not affect the original document unless collaborators "commit" changes)
1. Writer 1/ "Master"- Create a repository and create the foundation of story
2. Writer 2- "Fork" the repository, then add changes, then submit a "pull request" to "master" writer
3. Writer 1- Review suggestions and then "Merge" and "commit" to make changes permanent 

Additional Possibilities: 
1. Introduce basic code to the students, such as formatting a paragraph.
2. Expand collaboration to Upper School coding class to have other students format stories, using code more extensively.
3. "Publish" writing projects to public forum for a broader audience. 

Summary:  Learning the program together was a true PBL experience as we began with the more com[plicated strategy outlined as the Alternate/dvanced revising strategy described above. Through trial and error and furhter investigation, the more practical method of setting up collaborators described above was discovered. Brooke and Carol have been revising this document using that first more practical method.
